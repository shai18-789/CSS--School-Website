In today’s digital world, having an official website is essential for schools and universities. A website acts as a digital front door to the institution, providing accessible information to students, parents, teachers, and even potential enrollees. It represents the school’s identity and plays a big role in communication and connection with the academic community. 
 Many schools still rely on traditional methods such as bulletin boards or printed announcements, which can be easily missed or delayed. Others use social media platforms, but these are often scattered and not organized enough for official school operations. This creates problems like missed deadlines, lack of information, and confusion among students and parents. 
 To solve this, our project aims to build a website specifically designed for a school or university. The website will serve as a central platform that includes important sections such as announcements, academic programs, enrollment procedures, contact information, and more. It will be user-friendly, responsive on all devices, and easy to update even by non-technical staff. 
 This is important in today’s context, especially as technology continues to shape education. After the pandemic, online communication has become more crucial than ever. 
Schools must adapt by using digital tools that improve accessibility, transparency, and operational efficiency. 
 In conclusion, building a school or university website is not just a trend, it's a necessity. 
This project will help schools communicate better, manage information more effectively, and provide a reliable online presence that benefits both the institution and its community.
